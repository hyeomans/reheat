# Connection

Reheat uses the [`Connection`](/documentation/api/api/Connection) class to connect to instances of RethinkDB.

Each instance of `Connection` manages a connection pool to an instance of RethinkDB. The default configuration options
are sufficient for connecting to a default RethinkDB instance on `localhost`. Every `Model` you define needs an
instance of `Connection` in order to operate.

```js
var r = require('rethinkdb'),
	reheat = require('reheat'),
	Connection = reheat.Connection;

// Connect to a default RethinkDB instance
var connection = new Connection();

connection.run(r.tableList(), function (err, tableList) {
	// A default RethinkDB instance has one db ('test') with no tables
	tableList;  //  [ ]
});
```
